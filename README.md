# Seq2Seq-Translator
As you can probably tell from my profile picture, I am quite fond of Japan. However, I cannot actually speak, read, or write the language, regardless of whether it is Hiragana, Katakana, or Kanji. As such, I have created a Seq2Seq model for translating basic English phrases to Japanese.
